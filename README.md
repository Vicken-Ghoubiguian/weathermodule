## What is this project ?

This project is about the development of an API written in Go and using OpenWeatherMap to get and manipulate current weather datas from a wished city in a wished country.
This repository is composed of one Go file named *weathermodule.go* which contain the *WeatherModule* main type to get, to encapsulate and to manage weather, one Dockerfile to build your own Docker image to run examples, one *LICENCE* file to define the license (here the GNU version 3.0 one), the [*src*](https://github.com/Vicken-Ghoubiguian/weathermodule/tree/master/src) directory which contains all defined classes used in the WeatherModule type definition and the tthe [*samples*](https://github.com/Vicken-Ghoubiguian/weathermodule/tree/master/samples) directory which contain all defined samples to test locally the *WeatherModule* type, all of the other types used to define weather and their functions.

## Running with Docker

You can test all available samples with Docker. That will permit you to test the API, to study it, and to show how to integrate it in your own project. There is 2 ways to run the samples via Docker and to study their integration in it: with the current project's Dockerfile or the official Docker images hosted in the Docker Hub web service.

## Conclusion

It has been an exciting project, easily usable by anyone in any other project written in Go language regardless of its size (large or small) and which has broadened my knowledge in Go language development as potentially every other beginner or confirmed developer.
